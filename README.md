## How to get involved?

The following sections describe how to contribute to DSDC APIs.

### Using GitHub Discussions

We use GitHub discussions to start communication whether it is for public feedback, questions, discussions, suggestions, or announcements. Meeting notes and decisions will be recorded under each API section as they occur.

Discussions will be available through this repository and also available at the [dsdcapis organization](https://github.com/orgs/dsdcapis/discussions).

### Using GitHub Issues

Issues will be used to record future work, enhancements, or issues. Each repository will have issues individually for tracking purposes.

### Create a Pull Request

Pull requests (PR) can be created to contribute ideas directly to the repository. When making a PR, please include as much information and details into what will be addressed. If there is a matching GitHub issue or discussions, please include a reference to it.
